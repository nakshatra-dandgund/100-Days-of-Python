# ðŸ’­ Reflection - Day 3

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to take user input with `input()`.
- How to convert input values into integers.
- Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The importance of debugging when inputs or types donâ€™t match.

### âš¡ What Went Wrong
- At first, I forgot to convert the input into an integer, which caused a TypeError.
- Division sometimes gives long decimals â€” learned that Python supports float results.

### ðŸ’ª My Feelings
This was a fun and satisfying exercise!  
I actually felt like I created a real, working tool for the first time.

### ðŸŒ± Next Steps
- Learn about **conditional statements** to add operation choices (like user selecting +, -, *, /).  
- Try using **functions** to make the calculator more modular.  
- Practice with **float inputs** and **error handling**.
