# ðŸ’­ Reflection - Day 2

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
- How to define and use variables.
- How arithmetic operations work in Python.
- The role of naming conventions in making code understandable.
- The importance of testing code after each change.

### âš¡ What Went Wrong
- Accidentally used a variable name ending with `_str` when it wasnâ€™t a string.

### ðŸ’ª My Feelings
Iâ€™m gaining confidence!  
Even though itâ€™s a small program, I now understand how Python handles numbers and variables.

### ðŸŒ± Next Steps
- Learn how to take user input.
- Practice type conversion (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`).
- Explore simple mathematical formulas using Python.
